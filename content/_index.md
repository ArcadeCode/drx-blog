# DRX blog
Welcome on my blog, my name is Dervaux Esteban, a young developers passionate of IT, I will on this blog share with you all my discovery and experimentation.

## Who I am ?
ðŸ¤š Hello, I'm Dervaux Esteban a passionate developer from when I've like 11 years. I learn everyday IT. If I need to say one word about me this will be "creative", I personally like stricts languages such as [TypeScript]() and [Rust (my lover)](), I also really  like C++. I'm a newbie in this three languages but my passion will send me to start with it !

## My experiences
I've started learning to programming using [Python](), after a overdose in highschool, i've changed by C and little bit later C++ for gain more control on my code and oh boy I've gotten le lot, after this experience I've jumped right into the Web 3.0 rabbit hole with [node.js](), [vue.js](), [vite.js](), TS, SASS, and a lot lot more.
